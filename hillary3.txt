You know, we started this great effort on a sunny July morning in Pinder’s Corner on Pat and Liz Moynihan’s beautiful farm. And 62 counties, 16 months, three debates, two opponents and six black pantsuits later, because of you, here we are.

(APPLAUSE)

You came out and said that issues and ideals matter; jobs matter, down state and upstate; health care matters; education matters; the environment matters; Social Security matters; a woman’s right to choose matters.

(APPLAUSE)

It all matters. And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart: Thank you, New York.

Thank you for opening up your minds and your hearts, for seeing the possibility of what we could do together for our children and for our future here in this state and in our nation. I am profoundly grateful to all of you for giving me the chance to serve you.

(APPLAUSE)

I will do everything I can to be worthy of your faith and trust, and to honor the powerful example of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

(APPLAUSE)

I would like all of you and the countless New Yorkers and Americans watching to join me in honoring him for his incredible half- century of service to New York and our nation.

Senator Moynihan, on behalf of New York and America, thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

And I thank Chuck Schumer for his generous support and friendship.

He has been and will be a great champion for the people of New York. And I very much look forward to fighting by his side in the United States Senate.

(APPLAUSE)

I want to thank both of my opponents, Mayor Giuliani and Congressman Lazio.

(APPLAUSE)

Congressman Lazio and I just spoke. I congratulate him on a hard-fought race, and I thank him for his service to the people of New York and Long Island. And I wish him, Pat and their two beautiful daughters well.

(APPLAUSE)

I promise you tonight that I will reach across party lines to bring progress for all of New York’s families. Today we voted as Democrats and Republicans; tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.

(APPLAUSE)

And how fortunate we are, indeed, to live in the most diverse, dynamic and beautiful state in the entire union.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, from the South Bronx to the southern tier, from Brooklyn to Buffalo, from Montauk to Massena, from the world’s tallest skyscrapers to breathtaking mountain ranges, I’ve met people whose faces and stories I will never forget.

Thousands of New Yorkers from all 62 counties welcomed me into your schools, your local diners, your factory floors, your living rooms and front porches. You taught me. You tested me. And you shared with me your challenges and concerns about overcrowded or crumbling schools, about the struggle to care for growing children and aging parents, about the continuing challenge of providing equal opportunity for all, and about children moving away from their home towns because good jobs are so hard to find in upstate New York.

Now, I’ve worked on issues like these for a long time. Some of them for 30 years, and I am determined to make a difference for all of you.

You see, I believe our nation owes every responsible citizen and every responsible family the tools that they need to make the most of their own lives. That’s the basic bargain I’ll do my best to honor in the United States Senate.

And to those of you who did not support me, I want you to know that I will work in the Senate for you and all New Yorkers. And to those of you who worked so hard and never lost faith, even in the toughest times, I offer you my undying gratitude.

(APPLAUSE)

I will work my heart out for you for the next six years. And I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the steady support of so many people. I want to thank Charlie Rangel, Nita Lowey, and the entire New York Democratic congressional delegation, my future colleagues.

I’m very grateful for the support of our Democratic statewide elected officials and my good friends, Carl McCall (ph) and Elliott Spitzer (ph).

(APPLAUSE)

I want to thank Shelly Silver (ph) and all the Democratic assembly members, and Marty Connor and all the Democratic members of the state Senate. I want to thank all of my upstate friends who couldn’t be here tonight, including Tony Maccello (ph), Bill Johnson, Jerry Jennings (ph), Mike Breslin (ph), Mark Thomas (ph), all the county chairs and other elected officials.

And thank you to all of my down-state friends, Andy Spano (ph) and the county chairs and all the elected officials, and particularly my friends right here in New York City, the city-wide officials, the borough presidents, the City Council members. And two great friends, former Mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins.

And somebody just yelled: “Don’t forget Long Island. We got beat up out there.” And I am grateful to everybody from Long Island.

And I want to thank all my friends in the state Democratic Party leadership, Judith Hope (ph), Mike Shell (ph), Denise King (ph).

(APPLAUSE)

And to all the hard-working labor leaders who really helped turn out the vote today, Dennis Hughes (ph) and Dennis Rivera (ph), Randy Weingarten (ph), Lee Saunders (ph), Brian McLaughlin (ph), Tom Hobart (ph), Danny Donahue (ph), Ed Malloy (ph), and the other local, state and national labor leaders whose support was so crucial.

And I want to thank all of the people who started volunteering with me from the very beginning.

(APPLAUSE)

You knocked on doors, you raised funds, you built rallies, you did everything necessary to bring us to this point.

And today, I want to thank the 25,000 volunteers from all across the state, who started phone banking, knocking on doors, giving out palm cards the minute the polls opened at 6:00 a.m. and didn’t stop until the last voter left. You made a difference in this race, and I’m very grateful to you.

(APPLAUSE)

And I want to thank Harold Ickes, my campaign chairman; Bill DeBlasio, my campaign manager; and Gigi Georges, the coordinated campaign director. And I want to thank the best, hardest working campaign staff any candidate has ever had.

(APPLAUSE)

And, finally, I want to echo Chuck Schumer in saying that I know I would not be here without my family. And I want to thank my mother and my brothers, and I want to thank my husband and my daughter.

(APPLAUSE)

You know, because this campaign was about ideas and issues, we have a lot of work to do.

And I am looking forward to doing that work with all of you, from one end of the state to the other.

I, tonight, am just overwhelmed by the kindness and support that I’ve been given. And I will work my heart out for the next six years for all of you.

Thank you, thank you, thank you, and God bless you all.

(APPLAUSE)

Thank you and good night.

Thank you.
